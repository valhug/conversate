**Weekly Update Template**:
```
## Week 10 Update - May 30, 2025
### Completed This Week
- [x] **LangChain Strategic Research & Architecture Design**: Completed comprehensive investigation of LangChain framework for conversation personas with persistent memory
- [x] **RAG Implementation Strategy**: Designed Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture for conversation context and learning history
- [x] **Technical Integration Plan**: Confirmed seamless integration path with existing Next.js/Prisma stack using vector storage
- [x] **Production Readiness Validation**: Verified enterprise usage (LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna) confirms scalability and reliability
- [x] **Competitive Advantage Analysis**: Identified memory-enhanced conversations as unique market differentiator
- [x] **3-Phase Implementation Strategy**: Established clear roadmap (Foundation → RAG → Advanced Features) with timeline and priorities
- [x] **Documentation Updates**: Updated BRAINSTORMING_SESSIONS.md with Session #4 and IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md with strategic track

### In Progress
- [ ] **Frontend Upload Component** (0% complete - parallel with LangChain track)
- [ ] **LangChain Environment Setup** (0% complete - ready to begin Phase 1)

### Next Week Priority
- [ ] **Begin LangChain Phase 1**: Install LangChain packages and set up basic conversation memory architecture
- [ ] **Parallel Development**: Continue file upload UI component development alongside LangChain foundation
- [ ] **Vector Storage Setup**: Configure Chroma or FAISS for local development with conversation context storage
- [ ] **Conversation Memory Prototype**: Create basic LangGraph implementation for persistent conversation state

### Strategic Decisions Made
- [x] **LangChain Integration Approved**: Parallel development track for memory-enhanced conversation personas
- [x] **RAG Architecture Confirmed**: Vector storage approach for conversation context and learning history
- [x] **Competitive Strategy**: Memory-enhanced conversations as primary market differentiation

### Updated Metrics
- Phase 1: 95% complete (maintained - focus shifting to Phase 2 + LangChain)
- Phase 2: 30% complete (file upload backend ready, frontend development continues)
- LangChain Track: Research complete, implementation ready to begin
- Technical Debt Items: Stable - LangChain integration designed to work with existing architecture

## Week 9-10 Previous Update - May 30, 2025
### Completed This Week
- [x] **ESLint Configuration Optimization**: Fixed build-blocking errors by adding comprehensive ignore patterns for Prisma generated files in `web/eslint.config.mjs`
- [x] **Upload Route Type Safety**: Resolved 4 ESLint errors in `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` by implementing proper TypeScript interfaces and removing unused variables
- [x] **Authentication Edge Runtime Resolution**: Successfully fixed Edge Runtime compatibility issues with dual approach (Edge Runtime user-store + Node.js database services)
- [x] **End-to-End Authentication Verification**: Tested and confirmed complete registration → login → session flow working
- [x] **Type Definitions Enhancement**: Created comprehensive interfaces in `src/types/upload.ts` for file upload functionality

### In Progress
- [ ] **Frontend Upload Component** (0% complete - next priority)
- [ ] **Real File Processing Pipeline** (backend ready, processing logic needed)

### Next Week Priority
- [ ] **Build Drag-and-Drop Upload Interface**: Create user-friendly file upload component
- [ ] **Implement Cloud Storage Integration**: Replace mock file storage with AWS S3 or similar
- [ ] **Environment Variables Setup**: Configure .env.local for database connection

### Issues Discovered
- [x] **ESLint Prisma Compatibility** (Priority: High) - ✅ RESOLVED with ignore patterns
- [x] **Edge Runtime Auth Compatibility** (Priority: High) - ✅ RESOLVED with dual approach
- [ ] **File Storage Scalability** (Priority: Medium) - Mock storage not production ready

### Updated Metrics
- Phase 1: 95% complete (increased from 85% - authentication and build issues resolved)
- Phase 2: 30% complete (file upload backend infrastructure ready)
- Technical Debt Items: -2 (ESLint configuration, Authentication compatibility) +1 (Environment variables setup)

## Week 9 Update - May 28-29, 2025
## Week 9 Update - May 28-29, 2025
### Completed This Week
- [x] **Database Schema Implementation**: Created comprehensive Prisma schema with 12+ models for complete application data modeling
- [x] **File Upload API Backend**: Implemented complete upload endpoint with validation, authentication, and processing status tracking
- [x] **Database Services Layer**: Built full CRUD operations with proper TypeScript integration
- [x] **Authentication Integration**: Connected Auth.js with database services and user management
- [x] **Migration Setup**: Created initial PostgreSQL migration files with proper Auth.js compatibility

### In Progress
- [x] **Authentication Edge Runtime Issues** (95% complete - compatibility challenges discovered)
- [x] **Type Safety Implementation** (80% complete - ESLint errors blocking build)

### Next Week Priority
- [x] **Resolve Build-Blocking Issues**: Fix ESLint errors and authentication compatibility
- [x] **Complete Authentication Flow**: Ensure end-to-end user registration and login works
- [x] **Frontend Upload Component**: Start building user interface for file uploads

### Issues Discovered
- [x] **Prisma Edge Runtime Incompatibility** (Priority: High) - affecting authentication flow
- [x] **ESLint Configuration Conflicts** (Priority: High) - blocking Next.js build process

### Updated Metrics
- Phase 1: 85% complete (database and core infrastructure ready)
- Phase 2: 20% complete (file upload backend implemented)
- Technical Debt Items: +3 (Edge Runtime compatibility, ESLint configuration, Environment variables)
