## Session #2: Custom LLM Strategy & Personas
**Date**: May 28, 2025  
**Participants**: Core Team  
**Context**: API cost concerns and token limitations with third-party LLMs  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Active Discussion  

### Problem Statement
Current reliance on OpenAI and Anthropic APIs presents several challenges:
- **High Costs**: Token-based pricing becomes expensive at scale
- **Rate Limiting**: API quotas and throttling impact user experience  
- **Dependency Risk**: External service reliability and availability
- **Limited Customization**: Cannot tailor responses to specific learning needs
- **Future Scalability**: Costs will grow exponentially with user base

### Proposed Solution: Custom LLM with Conversation Personas
